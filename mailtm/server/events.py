"""
Module for events that get triggered in the Mail.tm server.

This module contains a set of classes representing different events that get triggered
in the `Mail.tm` server. These events can be used to create callbacks for when certain
actions happen in the server.

- `NewMessage`: Triggered when a new message is received.
- `MessageDelete`: Triggered when a message is deleted using the server instance.
- `DomainChange`: Triggered when the email domain is changed.
- `AccountSwitched`: Triggered when the account is switched to a different account.
- `NewAccountCreated`: Triggered when a new account is created.
- `AccountDeleted`: Triggered when an account is deleted.
- `ServerStarted`: Triggered when the server is started.
- `ServerCalledOff`: Triggered when the server is ended.
