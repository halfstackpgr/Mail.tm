- The library provides a way to reduce the memory load. 
- It uses hashmaps for caching the data required to compare and dispatch data related events. 
- The live system works on a routed method of pooling with API which makes it easy to interact with client.

## Comprehensive Documentation
Methods are constructed using the documentation,
available [here](http://docs.mail.tm).
The whole documentation is relying on what the API documentation is, apart from the attributes an instance of any JSON object represents.
Rather than manually spliiting the data and then patching their values under a class, this library directly uses Structs, to do it. 
>Similar to an example class like this all the objects, that is, the `abc`s are made in this library.
```python
class Account(x.Struct):
    account_id: Optional[str]
    another_field: Optional[str]
    some_more_field: Optional[str]
```

>Although the documentation has it's own essential importance. >The docstrings do contain all the necessary information one >would need to know about.
