# ABCs

??? question "How do we use this ?"
    We utilize this abstract base class to define a structured way of representing and interacting with data objects. By defining classes that inherit from these ABCs, we can create objects that not only provide a clear understanding of their contents, but also enable convenient and efficient data manipulation and traversal.


## General Objects

- These abstract base classes (ABCs) serve as a foundation for the modal classes, providing a structured way to interact with data objects.
- While they won't be directly used for data manipulation, they will be inherited by the modal classes, which will then utilize their functionality to provide a clear understanding of their contents and enable convenient and efficient data manipulation and traversal.

## Modal Objects
- Modal objects contain the classes that the user directly interacts with while using the SDK.
- These modals contain the data objects that the user interacts with while using the SDK.
